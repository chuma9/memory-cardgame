# Memory Card Game
## an interactive C# single player console application

Memory card game is an interactive single player console application built as a solution to the challenge question of the 2018 Kleiner Perkins Engineering Fellows application.

### Rules
The game uses a standard 52 card deck. The deck is shuffled at the start of the game and all the cards laid out face down in 4 rows of 13 cards each. Two cards are flipped each turn and the objective of the game is to flip matching pairs. A match is defined as two cards of the same rank (value) and color. (nine of hearts and nine of diamonds are a match and king of spades and king of clubs are a match) If two cards are a match, they are left face up and play continues, if not they are flipped back to face down before play continues. The game ends when all cards have been matched and are face up.
